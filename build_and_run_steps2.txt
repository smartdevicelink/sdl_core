This instruction contains the information on how to build and run SDL depending on target OS and HMI type
For some extra build options, look into doc/extra_build_and_run_options.txt

1) General workspace preparation
  1.1: Linux workspace preparation:
    1.1.1: Install Ubuntu/Xubuntu 12.04 or higher
    1.1.2: Configure source repositories (check "Canonical Partners" repositories in Update Manager->Settings->SW source).
            Note: Fore Ubuntu 12.04 "Update Manager->Settings->Other Software"
    1.1.3: Perform "sudo apt-get install git" command in terminal.
    1.1.4: Clone git repository with "git clone https://adc.luxoft.com/stash/scm/ford/applink.git ".
        Note: System will request your credentials.
    1.1.5. Switch to current release branch: "git checkout release/release_SDL_RB_Yx.x".
            Note: you can get list of branches with command "$ git branch -a | grep release_SDL_RB"
            Note: in above cases the <Project_Root_Src> is the path to 'Project_Root_Src' git folder (e.g. "/home/user_name/Work/Project_Root_src").
    1.1.6: SSH configuration on Linux host:
        Install Open-SSH server (For Xubuntu run "sudo apt-get install ssh", for Ubuntu run "sudo apt-get install openssh-server").
        Note: Restart computer if necessary.

  1.2: QNX workspace preparation
    1.2.1: Download and install VMware Player from https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/downloads
    1.2.2: Download the archived QNX image for VMware from ftp://ford-applink.luxoft.com/Distrs/QNX/QNX_SDP_6.5.0.tar.gz
    1.2.3: Extract image from archive and open it in VMware
            Note: QNX image has root with empty pass and user with pass 'user'. SSH is configured
    1.2.4: Log as root.
    1.2.5: Run “passwd user” and set the new user id (just press enter), group (just press enter) and non-empty password.
    1.2.6: Run "ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key".
    1.2.7: Run "ssh-keygen -t dsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key".
    1.2.9: Set up sshd to run at time login.
            Create file "/etc/profile.d/sshd.sh" with command "/usr/sbin/sshd"
    1.2.10: Set up USB access mode
              1.2.10.1: If file "/etc/rc.d/rc.local" is either absent or empty then copy file "<Project_Root_Src>/qnx/rc.local" to folder "/etc/rc.d"
              1.2.10.2: If file "/etc/rc.d/rc.local" exists and is nonempty then append the last line of file "<Project_Root_Src>/qnx/rc.local" to its end



2) Build and run on Linux with web HMI.
  2.1: Build SDL:
    2.1.1: Run "sudo -E ./setup_env.sh" to install all mandatory packages.
      Note: You should run setup_env.sh before first build of specific configuration.
      Note: More information about setup_env.sh flags you can get from doc/extra_build_and_run_options.txt
    2.1.2: Make build directory "$mkdir <Project_QNX_Build_WebHMI>  && cd <Project_QNX_Build_WebHMI>"
    2.1.3: Configure build "cmake <Project_Root_Src>".
    2.1.4: Build and install third party libs.
      Note: this step has to be done just once for each combination of target system (Linux/QNX) and CPU architecture (x86/armv7).
        "$ make 3rd_party"
        "$ sudo make install-3rd_party"
    2.1.5 Run build process "$make install"

  2.2 Run SDL:
    2.2.1: Go to the binary folder "cd <Project_Linux_Build_WebHMI>/bin".
    2.2.2: If Web HMI and SDL are running on separate computers:
        2.2.2.1: LinHost: update SDL config file “<Project_Root_Src>/src/appMain/smartDeviceLink.ini”: find  “ServerAddress = ” there and replace the value with <SDL server address>.
        2.2.2.2: LinHost: update Web HMI network parameters: in file "<Project_Root_Src>/src/components/HMI/app/Flags.js" find “WEBSOCKET_URL: ” and replace the value ("ws://localhost:8087") with <SDL server address>. (e.g. "url: "ws://<SDL adress>:8087"")
            Note: <SDL server address> is the IP of the computer where SDL is running.
    2.2.3: Prepare Policy.
            "$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:."
            "$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
           Note: If libPolicy.so is in other place then use following format:
                LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<PATH_TO_POLICY_LIBRARY>
    2.2.4. Run SDL "$ ./smartDeviceLinkCore".
           Note: HMI shall be started automatically.

3) Build and run on Linux with Qt HMI.
  3.1: Build step:
    3.1.1: Run "sudo -E ./setup_env.sh -qt" to install all mandatory packages.
      Note: You should run setup_env.sh only on first building target configuration.
      Note: More information about setup_env.sh flags you can get from doc/extra_build_and_run_options.txt
    3.1.2: Make build directory
              "$ mkdir <Project_Linux_Build_Qt>  && cd <Project_Linux_Build_Qt>
    3.1.3: Configure build "cmake <Project_Root_Src> -DHMI=qt".
    3.1.4: Build and install third party libs.
      Note: this step has to be done just once for each combination of target system (Linux/QNX) and CPU architecture (x86/armv7).
        "$ make 3rd_party"
        "$ sudo make install-3rd_party"
    3.1.5 Run build process “$make install”

  3.2 Run SDL:
    3.2.1: Go to the binary folder "cd <Project_Linux_Build_Qt>/bin".
    3.2.2: If HMI and SDL are running on separate computers:
        2.2.2.1: Set up "export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=tcp:host=<HOST>,port=<PORT>" on HMI side (e.g. "export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=tcp:host=192.168.243.131,port=8087").

    3.2.2: Prepare Policy.
          "$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:."
          "$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
         Note: If libPolicy.so is in other place then use following format:
              LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<PATH_TO_POLICY_LIBRARY>
    3.2.3. Run SDL "$ ./smartDeviceLinkCore".
         Note: HMI shall be started automatically.

4) Build and run on QNX with Web HMI

    4.1.2: Download and install QNX SDP 6.5.0 SP1 cross platform tools for Linux (http://www.qnx.com/download/download/21179/qnxsdp-6.5.0-201007091524-linux.bin).
            Note: it is necessary to obtain license key: either trial or commercial one (Register on http://www.qnx.com/ website, enter 'QNX product evaluation' and apply for a license key).
            Note: during tools installation mark "GNU Public Licence Utility" check-box.
    4.1.3: Make build directory (Linux Host )
        "$ mkdir <Project_QNX_Build_WebHMI>  && cd <Project_QNX_Build_WebHMI>
    4.1.4: Configure build:
        "$ cmake <Project_Root_Src> -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<Project_Root_Src>/qnx_6.5.0_linux_x86.cmake".
    4.1.5: Make third party libs:
        "$ make 3rd_party"
        "$ sudo make install-3rd_party"
    4.1.6 Run build process “$make install”

    4.2.3: QnxServ: download 3rd party folder “scp -r <linux_host_user>@<linux_host_ip>:/<Project_QNX_Build_WebHMI>/3rd_party/* ./” .
    4.2.4: Prepare Policy.
        "$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:."
        "$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
       Note: If libPolicy.so is in other place then use following format:
            LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<PATH_TO_POLICY_LIBRARY>
    4.2.5: Prepare log4cxx
       "$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<PATH_TO_3RD_PARTY_LIBS>"
       "$ e.g. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:../3rd_party/lib"
    4.2.6: QnxHost: update SDL config file “smartDeviceLink.ini”: find  “ServerAddress = ” there and replace the value with <SDL server address>.
    4.2.7: LinHost: update Web HMI network parameters: in file "<Project_Root_Src>/src/components/HMI/app/Flags.js" find “WEBSOCKET_URL: ” and replace the value ("ws://localhost:8087") with <SDL server address>. (e.g. "url: "ws://<SDL adress>:8087"")
           Note: <SDL server address> is the IP of the computer where SDL is running.
    4.2.8: start SDL “su -c ./smartDeviceLinkCore”.
    4.2.9. LinHost: start Chrome “chromium-browser '<Project_Root_Src>/src/components/HMI/index.html'”.
           Note: in case there is no connection with Web HMI probably it is necessary to add QNX Server IP to "no_proxy" config.

  5.1:Build Project
    5.1.1: Run "sudo -E ./setup_env.sh -qnx -qt" to install all mandatory packages.

                (e.g. "<listen>tcp:host=192.168.243.131,port=8087</listen><allow_anonymous/>).
          5.2.7.2: Execute
            "$ DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=`<PATH_TO_DBUS_DAEMON_BINARY>/dbus-daemon --config-file=<PATH_TO_DBUS_DAEMON_CONFIG>/session.conf --fork --print-address`"
