/*! \page components_smartobjects_validation Smart Objects validation

The mechanism of Smart Objects validation includes special Schema. This Schema is similar to the regular XML schema. In other words Schema defines structural description of desired object. After that definition is done Schema can be applied to the object in order to make validation.

Every Schema is constructed from objects called SchemaItems. Every SchemaItem defines type and restriction of specific data structure.
