/*! \page components_transportmanager_internal_design_multithreading Multi-Threading in Component

Internally Transport Manager uses different threads for different operations. This design solution was used to provide efficient asynchronous communication with clients and underlying Device Adapters.

Transport Manager uses one thread to operate with all device-related callbacks. In other word all callbacks declared in ns_smart_device_link::ns_transport_manager::ITransportManagerDeviceListener will be called from that thread.

For every active connection one service thread will be created. This thread will be used for all connection-related callbacks. Therefore every implementation of ns_smart_device_link::ns_transport_manager::ITransportManagerDataListener will be called in separated thread that allows client to support multiple connection simultaneously.
