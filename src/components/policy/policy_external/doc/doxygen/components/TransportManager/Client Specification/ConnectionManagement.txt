/** @page components_transportmanager_client_connection_management Connection Management
 *
 * As all requests to TransportManager are asynchronous, client must implement NsSmartDeviceLink::NsTransportManager::ITransportManagerDeviceListener
 * interface and add itself as a device listener with NsSmartDeviceLink::NsTransportManager::ITransportManager::addDeviceListener()
 * in order to receive notifications.
 * To connect remote device client must use NsSmartDeviceLink::NsTransportManager::ITransportManager::connectDevice(). It will initiate connections to all
 * applications running on remove device. For TCP device this call has no effect as TCP connections are initiated by remote devices.
 * Client will be notified about each connected application with NsSmartDeviceLink::NsTransportManager::ITransportManagerDeviceListener::onApplicationConnected().
 * To disconnect all applications running on remote device client must use NsSmartDeviceLink::NsTransportManager::ITransportManager::disconnectDevice().
 * Client will be notified about each disconnected application with NsSmartDeviceLink::NsTransportManager::ITransportManagerDeviceListener::onApplicationDisconnected().
