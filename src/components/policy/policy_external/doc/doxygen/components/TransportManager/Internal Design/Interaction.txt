Internally Transport Manager is a root component for Device Adapters. After running Transport Manager creates Device Adapters and runs them too.

During system life cycle all messages from Device Adapter are translated via Transport Manager to the clients. In other direction â€“ all requests from clients are re-directed to respective Device Adapters by the Transport Manager.
