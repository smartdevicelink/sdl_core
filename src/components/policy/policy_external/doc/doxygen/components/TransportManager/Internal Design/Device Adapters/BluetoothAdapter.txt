/** @page components_transportmanager_internal_design_transport_adapters_bluetooth_adapter Bluetooth Adapter
 *
 * Bluetooth adapter handles communication with external devices via bluetooth. It is implemented in
 * NsSmartDeviceLink::NsTransportManager::CBluetoothAdapter.
 *
 * @section components_transportmanager_internal_design_transport_adapters_bluetooth_adapter_discovery Device discovery
 *
 * When requested by a call to NsSmartDeviceLink::NsTransportManager::CTransportAdapter::scanForNewDevices() bluetooth adapter
 * searches for bluetooth devices. For each found device it runs SDP query for service with SmartDeviceLink UUID
 * (936DA01F-9ABD-4D9D-80C7-02AF85C822A8). Devices that support this service are added to bluetooth adapter device list.
 * Bluetooth device scans are performed only when explicitly requested.
 *
 * @section components_transportmanager_internal_design_transport_adapters_bluetooth_adapter_connecting_devices Connecting devices
 *
 * NsSmartDeviceLink::NsTransportManager::CBluetoothAdapter::createConnectionsListForDevice() runs SDP query for specified device
 * and fills connection list with connections to all RFCOMM channels on remote device where SmartDeviceLink service has been discovered.
