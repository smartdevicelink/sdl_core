Actually Transport Manager component is implemented as classical manager component. It manages connections and abstract devices and provides unified information for the clients.

Connection-related information encapsulated in structure NsSmartDeviceLink::NsTransportManager::CTransportManager::SConnectionInfo. Transport Manager manages these structures to store information about every active connection.

Frame processing encapsulated in structure NsSmartDeviceLink::NsTransportManager::CTransportManager::SFrameDataForConnection. Transport Manager manages these structures to store information related to data for specific connection.

Callback information between transport manager threads passed in form of special structures:
NsSmartDeviceLink::NsTransportManager::CTransportManager::SDeviceListenerCallback.
NsSmartDeviceLink::NsTransportManager::CTransportManager::SDataListenerCallback.

Client calls to TM guarded by separate mutex. This allows use component from different threads without any risk.
