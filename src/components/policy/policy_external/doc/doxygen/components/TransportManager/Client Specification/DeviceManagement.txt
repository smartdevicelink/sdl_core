/** @page components_transportmanager_client_device_management Device Management
 *
 * As all requests to TransportManager are asynchronous, client must implement ns_smart_device_link::ns_transport_manager::ITransportManagerDeviceListener
 * interface and add itself as a device listener with ns_smart_device_link::ns_transport_manager::ITransportManager::addDeviceListener()
 * in order to receive notifications.
 * Client of TransportManager may use ns_smart_device_link::ns_transport_manager::ITransportManager::scanForNewDevices()
 * to initiate device scan on all device adapters that support this feature. In order to get list of available
 * devices client must override ns_smart_device_link::ns_transport_manager::ITransportManagerDeviceListener::onDeviceListUpdated().
 * Each device adapter will perform scan independently from other device adapters and device list might be updated
 * several times (after each adapter that supports scanning finishes scanning operation). Device list might also be
 * updated without device scan request, e.g. if new client connects via TCP this device will be added to device list
 * and update notification will be sent to client. In any of these cases client will be provided with the full
 * device list from all device adapters in every notification.
