/** @page components_transportmanager_client_data_transfer Data Transfer
 *
 * As all requests to TransportManager are asynchronous, client must implement ns_smart_device_link::ns_transport_manager::ITransportManagerDataListener
 * interface and add itself as a data listener with ns_smart_device_link::ns_transport_manager::ITransportManager::addDataListener()
 * in order to receive notifications.
 * To send frame to remote device client must use ns_smart_device_link::ns_transport_manager::ITransportManager::sendFrame() poviding connection handle,
 * frame data, data size and user data. User data is an integer that is assigned to a frame and will be sent back to client when sending of frame
 * will be completed. Client may use this data to identify frame when send result will be reported. When sending of frame is completed
 * client is notified via ns_smart_device_link::ns_transport_manager::ITransportManagerDataListener::onFrameSendCompleted(). When frame is received from a remote
 * device client is notified via ns_smart_device_link::ns_transport_manager::ITransportManagerDataListener::onFrameReceived().
