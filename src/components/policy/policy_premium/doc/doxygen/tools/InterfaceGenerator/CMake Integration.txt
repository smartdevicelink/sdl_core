/*! \page tools_interfacegenerator_cmakeintegration Integration with CMake

In order to organize usable build process that allows to create generated code at every workstation in accordance with local setting and ensure that code re-generated after any modification in source XML or InterfaceGenerator itself was designed custom CMake rule "GenerateInterface".

This rule takes 3 arguments - name of source XML file, desired namespace for generated code and name of parser to use (name of parser is required because supported XML formats are indistinguishable and client must explicitly specify desired parser type).

Example:

<pre>
GenerateInterface("test_v4_protocol_v2_0_revP.xml" "Gen::test::components::JSONHandler" "alrpcv2")
</pre>
