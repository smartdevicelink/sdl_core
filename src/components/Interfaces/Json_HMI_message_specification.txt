This file describes message structure for communication between SDL and HMI.
JSON RPC 2.0 format is taken as basis. Please refer to http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification. Additions to this format are marked as 'Additions' hereinafter. Blocks marked as 'Spec' are excerpt from oficial specification of JSON RPC 2.0. Samples are also provided.
This document comes in pair with HMI_API.xml.

Notifications:

/****

	* Spec (from http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification):
	A Notification is a Request object without an "id" member. A Request object that is a Notification signifies the Client's lack of interest in the corresponding Response object, and as such no Response object needs to be returned to the client. The Server MUST NOT reply to a Notification, including those that are within a batch request.
***/

//No params:
{
	"jsonrpc" : "2.0",
	"method" : "UI.OnReady"
}

//With params:

{
	"jsonrpc" : "2.0",
	"method" : "BasicCommunication.OnDeviceListUpdated",
	"params" :

/*****
	Request-response pairs

	* Spec (from http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification):
	Request object
	A rpc call is represented by sending a Request object to a Server. The Request object has the following members:

		jsonrpc
		A String specifying the version of the JSON-RPC protocol. MUST be exactly "2.0".
		method
		A String containing the name of the method to be invoked. Method names that begin with the word rpc followed by a period character (U+002E or ASCII 46) are reserved for rpc-internal methods and extensions and MUST NOT be used for anything else.
		params
		A Structured value that holds the parameter values to be used during the invocation of the method. This member MAY be omitted.
		id
		An identifier established by the Client that MUST contain a String, Number, or NULL value if included. If it is not included it is assumed to be a notification. The value SHOULD normally not be Null and Numbers SHOULD NOT contain fractional parts

//Params in request

	"id" : 36,
	"jsonrpc" : "2.0",
	"method" : "UI.Alert",
	"params" :

	"method" : "Buttons.GetCapabilities"
}

/****
	* Spec (from http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification):
	Response object
	When a rpc call is made, the Server MUST reply with a Response, except for in the case of Notifications. The Response is expressed as a single JSON Object, with the following members:

		jsonrpc
		A String specifying the version of the JSON-RPC protocol. MUST be exactly "2.0".
		result
		This member is REQUIRED on success.
		This member MUST NOT exist if there was an error invoking the method.
		The value of this member is determined by the method invoked on the Server.
		error
		This member is REQUIRED on error.
		This member MUST NOT exist if there was no error triggered during invocation.
		The value for this member MUST be an Object as defined below.
		id
		This member is REQUIRED.
		It MUST be the same as the value of the id member in the Request Object.
		If there was an error in detecting the id in the Request object (e.g. Parse error/Invalid Request), it MUST be Null.
	* Additions:
		result MUST contain 'method' which has to be the same as in 'request'.


****/

/****
	* Error object
	When a rpc call encounters an error, the Response Object MUST contain the error member with a value that is a Object with the following members:

		code
		A Number that indicates the error type that occurred.
		This MUST be an integer.
		message
		A String providing a short description of the error.
		The message SHOULD be limited to a concise single sentence.
		data
		A Primitive or Structured value that contains additional information about the error.
		This may be omitted.
		The value of this member is defined by the Server (e.g. detailed error information, nested errors etc.).
	

	* Additions:
		result along with error MUST contain 'code' which is value from Result enum provided in HMI_API.xml
		error MUST contain 'method' which is the same as 'method' in request for this error in field 'data'.
