   * @brief RaiseFakeSuccessfulResponse raise event for the subscriber that

   * WayPointsPendingResumptionHandler freezes sending requests to HMI. But
   * resumption_data_processor().SubscribeOnResponse() need to be called to
   * provide information that some data need to be resumed. So if pending
   * request exists, SDL creates preliminary requests to HMI, subscribe the
   * subscriber to this request but do not send it to HMI. It freezes this
   * requests to precess the one by one when a response to the current request
   * will be received When SDL receives a response from HMI it may satisfy some
   * frozen requests. If it does SDL will create faked HMI response(based on the
   * real one with corr_id replacement) and raise event. So that
   * subscriber::on_event will be called with an appropriate response to the
   * request that SDL was not sent to HMI.
   * @param response message that will be raised with corr_id replacement
   * @param corr_id correlation id that will be replaced in response to notify
