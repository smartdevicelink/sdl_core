   * All such classes must declare instance() method as friend

   *definition:
   *
   * FRIEND_BASE_SINGLETON_CLASS(MySingleton);
   *
   * Instance of this class (if created) can be deleted by Deleter destructor
   * which is called after main() (or from exit())
   * This requires T destructor to be accessible for Deleter (e.g. public)
   * Deleter template parameter can be specified with any class
   * with public default constructor, destructor and method
   * void grab(T*);
   * However, default Deleter specification does nothing
   *
   * Also instance can be deleted explicitly by calling destroy() method
   *
   * Both instance() and destroy() methods are thread safe
   * but not thread safety between simultaneous calls
   * of instance() and destroy() is cared about
