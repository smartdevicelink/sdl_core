* Introduction
  ================
  appLinkCore is an application which manages the transport, connection and communication between a head unit and mobile device.

* OS and Hardware
  =========
  Ubuntu 12.04.01 LTS 32-bit OS on the PC with USB-dongle
  Application has been tested using 2 types of USB-dongle:
  D-Link DBT-122
  STLab B-121mini

* External components
  ===================
  For build application we need:
  libbluetooth3, the BlueZ library
  libbluetooth-dev, the development files to link to the BluetZ library.
  Install libraries:
  sudo apt-get install libbluetooth3
  sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-dev
  We are using cmake to create build configurations.
  Install cmake:
  sudo apt-get install cmake
  To start web-based HMI we need web-browser with web-socket RFC6455 support.
  For example Google Chromium. Install it using:
  sudo apt-get install chromium-browser

* Build application
  =================
  We support "out of sources" concept for build from R3.0.0
  It means all generated by build tools files will be stored in separate folder.
  
  1. Create directory outside of AppLink project directory.
  For example "build" folder in the same folder with AppLink git repo folder which has a name "git_repo":
  mkdir build
  You will have folders structure like this:
  /home/projects/applink
  |--build
  |--git_repo
     |--doc
     |--src
     |--test
     |--DoxyFile
     \--CMakeLists.txt
  Enter this folder:
  cd build
  
  2. Create build configuration using cmake:
  2.1 For Debug configuration
  cmake ../git_repo
  2.2 For Release configuration, run:
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../git_repo
  
  3. Make project:
  make
  
  Ready to use release application will be in build/src/appMain/appLinkCore
